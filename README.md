# CocktailDB

You should be able to clone this repository and run it without much issue. You may need to change the development team, but there are no special keys or instructions for running it. 

This is a project that was requested for an interview. There are some things in here that I wouldn't do in a regular project. For instance the API to the cocktail database returns all the same data,
but it was requested in this exercise to use different decoding strategies for each call. This allowed for having simple decoding for the results objects, and more complex deocding for the drinks.

The full cocktail db api can be found at: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php.
